Project Report: Flood Risk Management Database

PROJECT IDEA DEFINITION

The Flood Risk Management Database aligns closely with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13: Where the goal of climate action is to counteract the effects of climate change.

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:

1.Develop a comprehensive system to monitor environmental conditions and provide timely flood warnings.(Generate flood warnings based on sensor data and categorize them by severity (low, medium, high))
2.Optimize the allocation and management of resources during flood events (Ensure that resources are deployed effectively to areas in need, and monitor their usage during deployments)
3.Assess and mitigate the environmental impact of floods (Monitor environmental impacts such as noise levels and pollutants in greenspaces)
4.Maintain and improve the quality of greenspaces (Track maintenance activities, facilities, and user activities in greenspaces)
5.Enhance user engagement and ensure their safety during flood events(To monitor user activities in greenspaces and provide timely information and warnings to users)
6.Analyze and combine data from multiple sources to aid in decision-making (We have combined data from sensors, flood warnings, response teams, resources, and user activities to generate insights and support strategic planning and operational decisions)


KEY FUNCTIONALITIES 

1.Collect and manage data from various sensors (rainfall, water level, temperature) (Storing sensor data including location, type, and status)
2.Generate and manage flood warnings based on sensor data (To create flood warnings with different levels (low, medium, high) and timestamps)
3.Manage response teams and their deployment (We've stored information about response teams, including contact details and locations)
4.Track and allocate resources for flood response (Manage resources such as medical supplies, food, and shelter)
5.Monitor and manage the deployment of response teams and resources (Track deployment details including team ID, warning ID, resource ID, timestamp, and status)
6.Assess and record the environmental impact of floods (Monitoring environmental impacts such as noise levels and pollutants in greenspaces)
7.Manage and maintain greenspaces (Tracking greenspace attributes such as name, type, area, location, and status)
8.Store and manage location data (We've mintained detailed information about locations, including city, neighborhood, coordinates, population density, and address)
9.Monitor user activities and engagement in greenspaces (Track user information such as gender, city, visit frequency, and contact details)
10.Schedule and track maintenance activities in greenspaces (Recording maintenance details such as date, type, cost, and the person or team performing the maintenance)

MAIN STAKEHOLDERS:

1.Government Agencies  (Oversee and regulate flood monitoring and response efforts)
2.Emergency Response Teams  (Respond to flood warnings, deploy resources, and manage on-ground operations)
3.Local Communities  (Residents and businesses affected by floods)
4.Resource Providers  (Those to supply medical, food, and shelter resources)
5.Data Analysts  (To analyze data from sensors,flood warnings and environmental impacts)
6.Public Health Officials  (To monitor and address health impacts of floods)
7.General Public  (The individuals who utilize greenspaces and the ones alerted to floods)

HOW THIS PROJECT ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS:

1.To ensure public safety, efficient resource allocation, and compliance with regulations for Government agencies
2.To ensure efficient coordination and deployment to minimize flood impact and ensure public safety for Emergency Response Teams
3.They are able to receive timely warnings, support during floods, and access to resources and safe greenspaces for the local communities
4.Are able to ensure efficient distribution and usage of resources during flood events for resource providers
5.They are able to generate insights to improve flood response strategies and environmental management for data analyst
6.They are able to ensure public health and safety, manage medical resources, and provide health advisories for the publiic health officials
7.The general Public stay informed about flood risks, access safe greenspaces, and receive necessary support during floods
