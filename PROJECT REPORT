Project Report: Flood Risk Management Database

PROJECT IDEA DEFINITION

The Flood Risk Management Database aligns closely with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13: Where the goal of climate action is to counteract the effects of climate change.

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:

1.Create a complete environmental monitoring & flood warning system (Given some data from the sensors, create flood warning and tag them as low, medium or high)
2.Utilise and monitor resources during flood deployments (Deploy resources to where they are needed in an effective manner)
3.Evaluate and minimize flood consequences on the environment: (keep track of noise pollution, contaminant levels in green spaces.)
4.Enhance and ensure the quality of greenspaces (Tracking Maintenance Event, Exercise Equipment )
5.To promote engagement of users and safety during flood emergency events(To track user movements in greenspaces, provide information and alerts to users)
6.Integrated data from different sources to help make better decisions (we integrated data from sensors, flood warnings, response teams, resources and user activities to provide insights for strategic level planning/ operational decision making)

KEY FUNCTIONALITIES 

1.Acquisition & management of data from all sensors (rainfall, water level, temperature) (Sensor data based on location, type as well status is stored)
2.Flood warning generation and management (Based on sensor data, flood warnings can be generated with various levels (low, midrange, high) at different timestamps.)
3.Deployment of response teams (We have details of response team members including how to get in touch and their locations)
4.Resource tracking and allocation for flood response ( Manage resources: medical supplies, food, shelter)
5.Deployment Tracking to Monitor Deployment of response teams & resources (ID for Team | Warning ID | Resource ID | Time-stamp | Status)
6.Monitor environmental impacts (for example noise metres and pollutants in greenspaces)
7.Managing and preserving greenspaces by tracking attributes like name, type, area, location, and status.
8.Storing and organizing location data, which includes information on cities, neighborhoods, coordinates, population density, and addresses.
9.Monitoring user activities and engagement within greenspaces by tracking user details like gender, city, visit frequency, and contact information.
10.Scheduling and overseeing maintenance activities within greenspaces by recording maintenance specifics such as date, type, cost, and the individuals or teams conducting the maintenance.

MAIN STAKEHOLDERS:

1.Government Agencies (Manage and monitor their flood control network )
2.Emergency Response Teams  (Activate on flood warnings, dispatch resources and manage ground operations)
3.Local Communities  (Residents and local businesses impacted by floods)
4.Resource Providers  (Those to supply medical, food, and shelter resources)
5.Data Analysts  (To analyze data from sensors,flood warnings and environmental impacts)
6.Public Health Officials  (To monitor and address health impacts of floods)
7.General Public  (The individuals who utilize greenspaces and the ones alerted to floods)

HOW THIS PROJECT ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS:

1.To ensure public safety, efficient resource allocation, and compliance with regulations for Government agencies
2.To guarantee efficient coordination and deployment to minimize flood impact and ensure public safety for Emergency Response Teams
3.They can receive timely warnings, flood support, and access to resources and safe greenspaces for local communities
4.Ensure efficient distribution and utilization of resources during flood events for resource providers
5.Generate insights to enhance flood response strategies and environmental management for data analysts
6.Ensure public health and safety, manage medical resources, and provide health advisories for public health officials
7.The general public remains informed about flood risks, access safe greenspaces, and receive necessary support during floods
